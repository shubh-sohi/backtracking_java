# backtracking_java  

Done as a class assignment. Program uses backtracking and recursion to compute the desired result . 
* The program computes the total minimum number of crossings that are required to join N horizontally drawn lines. 
* The program takes the brute force approach to generate all the possible outcomes and then uses backtracking to check for possible un crossed connections, if no possible connections exist, it determined the best position to cross and finally computes the total minimum crossing.
